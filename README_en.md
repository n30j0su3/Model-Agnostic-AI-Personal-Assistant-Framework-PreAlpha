## 🎯 Purpose and Philosophy

**What is this?**

An artificial intelligence assistant that lives on **your computer**, not on third-party servers. Your conversations, documents, and knowledge remain in local files that **you completely control**.

**The philosophy is simple:**

- 📍 **Local-first**: Everything works on your PC, without constantly depending on the internet
- 🔐 **Your control**: Your information is never sold or used to train external models
- 🔄 **No vendor lock-in**: Works with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or local models. You choose.

> *"True knowledge transcends to the public, but must remain under your control."*

## ⚡ Quick Start (Windows)

> 💡 **Also available for Mac and Linux** - see notes at the end.

### Step 1: Download
```powershell
# Option A: With Git (recommended for updates)
git clone https://github.com/n30j0su3/Model-Agnostic-AI-Personal-Assistant-Framework-PreAlpha.git

# Option B: Download ZIP from the Releases page above ↑
```

### Step 2: Run
```powershell
# Enter the folder and run:
cd Model-Agnostic-AI-Personal-Assistant-Framework-PreAlpha
pa.bat
```

### Step 3: Configure
The installer will ask you 3 simple questions:
1. What language do you prefer? (Spanish/English)
2. What AI tool will you mainly use? (OpenCode, Claude, etc.)
3. What's your name? (to personalize the assistant)

### Done! 🎉

Your assistant is configured. Now you can:
- Type `pa.bat` to start a session
- Edit files in the `workspaces/` folder to give it context
- Ask for help with documents, data, or daily tasks

## 📋 Requirements

### Hardware
| Minimum | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| 4-core CPU | 8-core CPU |
| 8 GB RAM | 16 GB RAM |
| 2 GB free space | 5 GB free space |

### Software
- **Windows 10/11** (also available for macOS 12+ and modern Linux)
- **Python 3.11+** *(installs automatically if missing)*
- **Git** *(optional, only for updates)*

### Optional: AI Accounts
To use advanced models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) you'll need:
- A free account with the provider of your choice
- API key (we explain how to get it in the full documentation)

> 💡 **Works without API key too** - you can use free local models like Ollama.

## ❓ Basic FAQ

**Do I need to know programming?**
→ **No.** This guide is designed for anyone. If you know how to use a basic terminal, that's enough.

**Is it free?**
→ **The framework is 100% free** (MIT license). Some AI providers (OpenAI, etc.) may charge for intensive use, but there are free options available.

**Is my data mine?**
→ **Yes, completely.** Everything stays on your computer in text files. We don't send your information to external servers without your explicit permission.

**Can I use it without internet?**
→ **Partially.** The framework works offline, but you'll need internet to query cloud AI models. You can also install local models (like Ollama) for 100% offline work.

**How do I update the framework?**
If you used Git: `git pull`. If you downloaded ZIP: download the new version and copy:
- `core/.context/` → framework configuration
- `workspaces/` → your working files
- Optional: `docs/` and `config/` if you customized documentation or configuration

**What if something doesn't work?**
→ Check our complete documentation or open an issue on GitHub. The community will help you.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Thanks to God for the Grace, Revelation, and Discernment necessary to build this framework.

Special thanks to **[NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck)** for inspiring the central philosophy of this project:

> *"I own my context. Nothing annoys me more than when AI tries to fence me in, give me vendor lock-in. No, I reject that."*

His focus on data sovereignty and accessible learning was fundamental to the design of this framework.

## 🍎 🐧 Note for Mac and Linux Users

This framework also works on **macOS 12+** and **modern Linux** (Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora, etc.).

**Equivalent commands:**
```bash
# Instead of pa.bat, use:
./pa.sh

# Installation:
python3 scripts/install.py
```

The structure and operation are identical. Only the script file extensions change.
